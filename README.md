# Laravel 8 Social Login with Facebook, Google and GitHub using Laravel Socialite.


## Introduction

I got a task on SheCodeAfrica Levelled MembershipðŸ¤—. The task included implementing Social Login to a Laravel Application. 
This basically means users should be able to sign up or sign in with any of their social accounts.
In this guide, Iâ€™ll be using Laravel Socialite to implement for Google, Facebook and GitHub.


### Laravel Socialite

Laravel also gives a basic and helpful way to verify with OAuth providers utilizing Laravel Socialite. Socialite as of now supports authentication with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
